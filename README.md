# Unit Testing with xUnit in ASP.NET Core
In order to test our application by using xUnit testing framework, we proceeded as follows: 
 - Create the xUnit project
 - Make project reference to the main project
 - Using `[Fact]`, `[Theory]`, and `[InlineData]` attributes. 
 - Also, we have created several tests to test our validation logic from the **AccountNumberValidation** class.
